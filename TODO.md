Open points
===========

* 404 page

* Generic error page

* Check TODOs in source code

* User related Tests use unencoded Passwords. Think of changing this, and what it provides.

* Integrate example admin page with spring security, does not work currently.

* Firstname and lastname attributes for users table et al.

* Unregister, delete account logic

* Provide way to disable app globally either via DB or with special file: google for better solution

* Local dummy mail server for running/testing on machines without SMTP. Check http://code.google.com/p/subethasmtp/
  pr use GreenMail for integration testing. This way we may get the last message received and thus may eliminate our
  MailSender stuff contained in testing.

* Create README.md
